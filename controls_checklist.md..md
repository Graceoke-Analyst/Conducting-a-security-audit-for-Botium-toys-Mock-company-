# Botium Toys Security Control Compliance Checklist
# Controls assessment checklist


| Control | Compliance Status | Rationale / Observation |
|----------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Least Privilege | ❌ No | Currently, all employees have access to customer data; privileges need to be limited to reduce the risk of a breach. |
| Disaster Recovery Plans (DRP) | ❌ No | There are no disaster recovery plans in place. These need to be implemented to ensure business continuity. |
| Password Policies | ❌ No | Employee password requirements are minimal, which could allow a threat actor to more easily access secure data or other assets via employee work equipment or the internal network. |
| Separation of Duties | ❌ No | Needs to be implemented to reduce the possibility of fraud or access to critical data, since the company CEO currently runs day-to-day operations and manages the payroll. |
| Firewall | ✅ Yes | The existing firewall blocks traffic based on an appropriately defined set of security rules. |
| Intrusion Detection System (IDS) | ❌ No | The IT department needs an IDS in place to help identify possible intrusions by threat actors. |
| Backups | ❌ No | The IT department needs to have backups of critical data, in the case of a breach, to ensure business continuity. |
| Antivirus Software | ✅ Yes | Antivirus software is installed and monitored regularly by the IT department. |
| Manual Monitoring for Legacy Systems | ⚠️ Partial | The risk assessment indicates that these systems are monitored and maintained, but there is not a regular schedule in place for this task and procedures/policies related to intervention are unclear, which could place these systems at risk of a breach. |
| Encryption | ❌ No | Encryption is not currently used; implementing it would provide greater confidentiality of sensitive information. |
| Password Management System | ❌ No | There is no password management system currently in place; implementing this control would improve IT department and employee productivity in the case of password issues. |
| Physical Locks (Offices/Warehouse) | ✅ Yes | The store’s physical location, which includes the company’s main offices, storefront, and warehouse of products, has sufficient locks. |
| CCTV Surveillance | ✅ Yes | CCTV is installed and functioning at the store’s physical location. |
| Fire Detection / Prevention | ✅ Yes | Botium Toys’ physical location has a functioning fire detection and prevention system. |

To address gaps in compliance, Botium Toys needs to implement controls such as Least Privilege, separation of duties, and encryption. The company also needs to properly classify assets, to identify additional controls that may need to be implemented to improve their security posture and better protect sensitive information.
