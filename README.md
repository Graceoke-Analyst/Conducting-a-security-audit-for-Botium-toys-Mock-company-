# Full Scope Risk Assessment & Control Audit (Botium Toys)
Executive summary: This project demonstrates a full-scope, four-phase security audit focusing on risk quantification and control assessment. Key deliverables include a Risk Assessment report, and a Control Checklist identifying critical gaps in the environment's security posture.
Tools:Risk Assessment & GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance),NIST CSF (Framework),Qualitative Risk Matrix (Likelihood/Severity),Microsoft Word(Used for final report generation and formatting).
The challenge: Goal-Identify the two most critical control gaps that expose Botium Toys' customer data and reduce system uptime.
Context:Audit of a simulated e-commerce SMB (Small-to-Medium Business) environment. The assessment covered controls related to access management, data recovery, and least privilege to establish a security baseline.
Action:Asset Classification	Classified key assets (e.g., Customer Database, Data retention and storage) based on their Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) triad requirements.
Control Assessment, Developed and executed a Compliance Checklist to evaluate existing controls (e.g., 'Do employees follow the principle of Least Privilege?').
Risk Scoring, Used a 5x5 Likelihood-Severity Matrix to calculate the inherent and residual risk scores for potential threats (e.g., unauthorized access, password policies).
Documented all findings in the final Control and Compliance Checklist 
Result and Impact: Key findings-The audit confirmed a High Risk score associated with the lack of a formalized Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP), which would lead to unrecoverable data loss in a major incident.
Mitigation/Recommendation: Recommended the immediate creation of an asset inventory and implementation of Role-Based Access Control to enforce least privilege access.
Artifacts: All evidence files generated during the audit are available below for review.
